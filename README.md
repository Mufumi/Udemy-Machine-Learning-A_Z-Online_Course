This repository contains the project content covered in the Udemy Machine Learning A-Z online course

# Future work

For the course, implementation of the project should be done in [Python](https://github.com/Mufumi/Udemy-Machine-Learning-A_Z-Online_Course/tree/main/Python) or R. I have currently only done the course in Python. An R implementation will be completed in time
